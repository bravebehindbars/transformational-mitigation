No stone is left unturned and all mitigating factors are uncovered and described in great details. Collateral evidence of all mitigating factors are included. Our mitigation experts are trained to identify when specific assessments and expert testimony are useful and we coordinate these pieces and integrate results into the report.

We work with each client to connect the dots as to how their past led them to the present moment. It is a process of developing insight and accountability.
                We hold space for our client to feel their feelings; often of shame and regret. Ultimately our paradigm is one of deep inner transformation. A clientâ€™s letter of remorse is authentically reflective of this deeply emotional journey. It is critically meaningful to the judge for the purpose of sentencing, parole, or clemency. </p>

Customized plans include mental health treatment (if appropriate) and/or a personalized community service opportunity building on our clientâ€™s strengths, past service work, AND that has a direct anecdotal relationship to the offense itself. The plan will show that the client is learning from their greatest wrongdoing and is trying to
                use this knowledge to benefit others. If your client is in need of continued services,  treatment, and monitoring we can connect them with the most appropriate resources available to meet their ongoing needs.</p>

Through journaling and motivational sessions we work with your client through a trauma-informed lens to connect the dots in their life leading up to the present moment. Gaining the insight to take full responsibility for their actions and feel remorse for their wrongdoing. From there we can do deep healing work of their trauma so that they can be on a healthy and productive path.</p>

                  <p> 29-year-old client facing charges including VOP and aggravated trafficking. With mitigation, the attorney was able to leverage the Kennebec CARA program. </p>

                  <p> "Getting the CARA program is definitely better than I ever hoped for. I really never imagined a scenario where I wouldnâ€™t be in jail or treatment for quite a while. The program is supposed to help transition me back to freedom with housing and other support which is a big relief. I appreciate all the work you put into making that happen. Iâ€™ve never had a person to talk about the events and issues that have led me here and you were always willing to listen, thank you. I believe I will make the most out of this opportunity and hopefully improve the relationship with my family and others. You not only gave me the opportunity but also began that process. When I complete the program, I will make sure to let you know how I am doing. Thank you for everything." -"TB" </p>
